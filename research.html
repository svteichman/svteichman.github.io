<h1>Research</h1>

<h4>Visualization of phylogenetic trees</h4>
<p class="content" style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
  I work with <a href = "http://statisticaldiversitylab.com/">Amy Willis</a> to develop methods to compare and visualize phylogenetic trees. 
  We are currently developing a visualization tool to help researchers compare individual gene phylogenies in order to identify genes that have evolved differently and the effect of these outlying genes on an estimated genome level phylogenomic tree.

<h4>Statistical modeling of wage heterogeneity</h4>
<p class="content" style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
  I have worked with <a href = "https://thmccormick.github.io/">Tyler McCormick</a> to develop a Bayesian hierarchical model to study wage heterogeneity. 
  This project uses longitudinal survey data to study variation in wages in low resource settings.
