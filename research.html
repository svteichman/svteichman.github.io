<h4>Statistical methods development for phylogenetic trees</h4>
<p class="content" style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
  I work with <a href = "http://statisticaldiversitylab.com/">Amy Willis</a> to develop methods to compare and visualize phylogenetic trees. 
  We are currently developing a visualization tool to help researchers choose which genes to include in an estimated consensus phylogeny.

<h4>Statistical modeling of wage heterogeneity</h4>
<p class="content" style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
  I work with <a href = "https://thmccormick.github.io/">Tyler McCormick</a> to develop Bayesian hierarchical models for wage heterogeneity. 
  We use longitudinal survey data to study variation in wages in low resource settings.
