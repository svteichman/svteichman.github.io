	<h1>About me</h1>
	<p>I'm a second-year PhD student in the <a href = "http://www.stat.washington.edu/">Department of Statistics</a> at the University of 
		Washington. My research interests include methods for longitudinal surveys and networks. I currently work with Tyler McCormick 
		on methods to study wage heterogeneity through Bayesian hierarchical modeling. </p>
	<p>I received my undergraduate degree in Statistics from Amherst College in 2018.</p>
