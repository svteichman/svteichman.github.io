  <p class="lead">
  I am a PhD student in the <a href = "http://www.stat.washington.edu/">Department of Statistics</a> 
    at the University of Washington. My research is focused on model development for compositional data applied to the
    microbiome, advised by 
    <a href = "https://faculty.washington.edu/dwitten/">Daniela Witten</a> and 
    <a href = "https://faculty.washington.edu/adwillis/">Amy Willis</a>. My research is supported by an 
<a href="http://www.nsfgrfp.org/">NSF Graduate Research Fellowship</a>. <br/>

Before coming to UW, I was an undergraduate at <a href = " https://www.macalester.edu/">Macalester College</a>
